            <p><strong>Curse that stupid cat!</strong> Dumb Bob knocked over my love again! <strong>Oh, Rose… </strong>I shall come to your <em>rescue</em>!
            Although… Our balcony is at the third floor. And… it’s quite dark outside; it’s almost midnight.
            Stiffen up, cowardly plant! Rose certainly deserves better than a <i>nyctophobiac</i> weed!</p>
             …
            <p>As I said, I shall come to your <em>rescue</em>!</p>
            <br>
            <p>Here I am, Rose! Where are you? Where on earth, has that stupid cat thrown you away?
            Oh, no! The <strong>sewer</strong>! Just under the balcony! My poor love… You need my help, but I am so afraid of the dark and filthy sewer. 
            The stories I’ve heard… The perfidious beings that dwell in the stink…</p>
            …
            <p>You need my help… <strong>I shall come to your rescue!</strong></p>
